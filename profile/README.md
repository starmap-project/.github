StaRMAP (Staggered grid Radiation Moment Approximation) is a simple method to solve spherical harmonics moment systems, 
such as the the time-dependent PN and SPN equations, of radiative transfer. The approach works for arbitrary moment order N, 
making use of the specific coupling between the moments in the PN equations and 1D to 3D spatial geometries. The method allows for an efficient implementation in Matlab.
